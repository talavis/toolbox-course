=======

This project contains a small program to brew beer and distill whiskey. It is
full of bugs and is missing a build system. Your task is to:

* Create a build system using CMake:
  * Build a shared library
  * Build and link the main program
  * Create an installer so the program can be installed properly (GNU
    standards)
  * Compile a parallel version with OpenMP
* Find all bugs using valgrind and fix them
* Find all parallelization bugs using helgrind (part of valgrind)
